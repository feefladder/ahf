socio-cultural context
----------------------

The Jos plateau is inhabited by people from Berom tribe, and pastoralists from
the Fulani tribe.

biophysical context
-------------------

The Jos plateau has been a site for open-cast tin mining, where several
government attempts had been made for reclaiming these lands for agriculture.
These have been largely unusccessful. However, farmers have autonomously, and
unaware of these government attempts, reclaimed these lands for agriculture,
using complex fertilization strategies and diesel pumps for irrigation

Fertility management
....................

Fertility management, and it's effect on long-term soil health are an important
topic. Farmers on the Jos plateau employ diverse management strategies,
including farmyard manure, artificial fertilizers and waste ash
:xcite:`[@YilaAdoptionAgriculturalLand2008; @PasquiniSoilFertilityManagement2005]`.
These all have their respective benefits and drawbacks, as
:xcite:`[@YilaAdoptionAgriculturalLand2008]` describes.

#. Farm yard manure is increasingly being superseded by artificial fertilizers,
   "According to two-thirds of the farmers, the difficulty in carrying bulky FYM
   to distant farm-plots was the main reason for such change."
   :xcite:`[@YilaAdoptionAgriculturalLand2008]`. Furthermore, livestock heads
   have decreased, due to:

  #. Decrease in labour availability.
  #. Irrigation on lowlands, as a result of which drinking places have
     disappeared .
  #. High livestock mortality due to prevalent diseases.

#. Artificial fertilizer is increasingly being used, but farmers have restricted
   access to it, and it is becoming prohibitively expensive.

#. Town refuse ash has increased in popularity, mainly because artificial
   fertilizers are expensive, and town waste is collected. However, since the
   waste is not separated before burning, due to dangers in handling municipal
   waste and ease of transport of ash, as opposed to waste
